## What This Is

India Credit Lens (`indiacreditlens.com`) turns Indian regulatory credit reports into
structured, executive-level insights for NBFCs, banks, fintechs, PE/VC funds.

**Differentiator:** Causal model layer — explains *why* credit moved, not just that it moved.
**Model:** Content ladder from free (LinkedIn/Substack) → paid (SaaS + consulting).

---

## Decision Filter

Before any feature, report, content, or technical decision:

1. Does it build expert positioning in the Indian lending ecosystem?
2. Does it attract CPOs, CROs, credit analysts, PE/VC at NBFCs/banks/fintechs?
3. Does it move toward a monetisable asset (consulting, CPO role, or SaaS subscriber)?

No to all three → deprioritise.

## CLI Tools

Use CLI tools for all external service interactions — they are the most context-efficient approach (one line of output vs loading API JSON).

### External services

| Tool | Use for |
|---|---|
| `gh` | PRs, CI status, issues, release notes — never use GitHub web for anything scriptable |
| `vercel` | Domain management, deployment status, env vars |

### Pipeline gates (always use these — never run validators ad-hoc)

| Tool | Use for |
|---|---|
| `python3 analysis/run_evals.py` | SIBC gate — Stages 0–6 (data integrity + signal + model validation) |
| `python3 analysis/run_atm_pos_evals.py --xlsx {file}` | ATM/POS gate — Stages 0–3 + L1 signal append + build |
| `python3 analysis/promote_annotations.py` | Stage 7: verified copy annotations_merged.ts → rbi_sibc.ts — never `cp` or manual paste |
| `python3 analysis/detect_format.py` | Stage 0: flag format changes before extraction (SIBC) |
| `python3 analysis/source_claims.py` | Post-model-update: source all system model claims (run after any Layer 2a model change) |
| `python3 analysis/generate_signal_history.py append --pipeline {name} --period {date}` | Stage 4: Layer 1 signal compute → writes to signals.db + updates registry |
| `python3 analysis/generate_signal_history.py evaluate --pipeline {name} --period {date}` | Stage 5: LLM signal evaluate → evaluations JSON; auto-loads prior period for narrative diff |
| `python3 analysis/generate_signal_history.py status` | Print current signal states across all pipelines |
| `python3 analysis/validate_signal_history.py` | Check 2e: signal history integrity — DB rows, registry schema, status sync vs DB |
| `python3 analysis/newsletter/validate_newsletter_config.py` | Newsletter gate — exception path, not part of standard pipeline |

## Authoring Rules (non-negotiable)

### Visual outputs
1. **ASCII layout first** — proportions, zones, text hierarchy
2. **Explicit approval** — no code until layout confirmed
3. **Then implement** — translate approved ASCII directly

### SIBC date normalisation (non-negotiable — read before any consolidation)

RBI publishes Statement 1 (Bank Credit / Food Credit / Non-food Credit) as a fortnightly
release — always a Friday, which can fall in the first week of the **following** month.
That publication date must be remapped to the **prior** month-end. Two rules are hard-coded
in `update_web_data.py`; specific edge cases live in `{period}/date_overrides.json`.

| Published on | Maps to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Apr 1–7 | Mar 31 | Post-FY-end Bank Credit release — Apr 4–5 = March data |
| May 1–7 | Apr 30 | Post-April Bank Credit release — May 2–3 = April data |
| Mar 1–7 | Feb 28/29 | Early-March Bank Credit = February data — captured in `date_overrides.json` for the period |
| Any other date | Last day of same month | Mid-month sector snapshot → month-end |

**Before `update_web_data.py` writes the CSV:** always show the full remapping table
(overrides applied + normalization applied) and wait for explicit user confirmation.
This is the same A/B gate as `detect_format.py` — never skip it.

When a new XLSX introduces dates not covered by the rules above, ask the user to classify
each raw date before proceeding. Document the decision in `{period}/date_overrides.json`
if it is a semantic correction (early-month = prior-month data); the normalization rule
handles formatting-only cases automatically.

### Analysis outputs
- `annotation_ids` in `system_model.json` must **exactly match** `id` fields in the annotations file. Copy-paste — never retype.
- **Annotation IDs are permanent.** Once an `id` exists in `annotations_merged.ts`, it is never renamed or deleted — even across FOUNDATION rebuilds. UPDATE mode only adds. FOUNDATION mode may restructure, but any removed ID requires explicit justification after `promote_annotations.py --dry-run`.
- **Layer 2a model has two modes — read `PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` before every model update pass.** FY-end (March file) = FOUNDATION. All other months = UPDATE. Wrong mode = wrong depth of analysis. Signal evaluation (Stage 5) runs every period regardless of mode.
- Stage 7 always uses `promote_annotations.py` — never manual copy.

### Git / deployment
- **Solo project — work directly on `main`. Never create feature branches or worktrees.**
- Never auto-push to GitHub
- Always run `python3 analysis/run_evals.py` (includes `npm run build`) before `git push`
- Show results and wait for explicit confirmation

### Newsletter subsystem

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `analysis/newsletter/CLAUDE.md` | Newsletter + LinkedIn generation context — read before any content generation |
| `analysis/newsletter/newsletter_config.json` | Current issue config — signals, hero narrative, image assignments |
| `analysis/newsletter/signal_registry.json` | Cumulative signal tracker — update before each issue |
| `analysis/newsletter/newsletter_delta_brief.py` | Generates delta_brief from merged outputs for newsletter authoring |
| `analysis/newsletter/validate_newsletter_config.py` | Gate: validates config before generation |
| `analysis/newsletter/generate_images.py` | Renders Mermaid .mmd → PNG for newsletter + LinkedIn |
| `analysis/newsletter/generate_newsletter.py` | Renders newsletter HTML (standard + Substack) |
| `analysis/newsletter/generate_linkedin.py` | Renders 7-post LinkedIn package (1 anchor + 6 signal posts) |

---

## Skills (load on demand — not every session)

| Skill | When to invoke |
|---|---|
| `/per-period-analysis` | Writing `delta_brief.md` for a new period (lightweight — ~150 words) |
| `/merged-analysis` | Layer 2a model UPDATE or FOUNDATION pass — check `is_fy_end` in timeline first |
| `/add-new-report` | Full walkthrough: adding a new SIBC period end-to-end |

Newsletter and LinkedIn generation are an exception path — not yet standardised to the unified pipeline architecture. Run scripts directly per `analysis/newsletter/CLAUDE.md` only when explicitly resuming newsletter work.

Use `Use a subagent to investigate X` when exploring data files — keeps main context clean.

---

## Compaction Instructions

When compacting, always preserve:
- Current pipeline stage (e.g. "Stage 3, per-period 2026-03-30, evals failing on Check 4")
- Period directory being worked on
- Any unresolved eval errors and which check they came from
- File paths of outputs written this session

## Session Notes (CLAUDE.local.md)

For session-specific state (current period, what's been validated, what's pending), write to `CLAUDE.local.md` at repo root — it is git-ignored and does not affect the shared context.

---

## Next Builds

See `STRATEGY_PLANNER.md` for the prioritised roadmap. Immediately next:

1. **Ingest next SIBC + ATM/POS period** — files expected soon; run full pipeline gate after ingestion
2. **UI wiring for L1 signals** — wire UI to consume from evaluation JSONs instead of hand-authored annotations for L1 signals; requires:
   - Add `chart_series` + `chart_dim` fields to registry.json per L1 signal (maps signal → chart highlight)
   - `preferredMode` derivable from compute method type (yoy→"yoy", abs→"absolute", fy_acceleration→"fy")
   - Build `generate_analysis_report.py` output formatter
3. **Two ATM/POS signal gaps to fix**:
   - `dc-psb-share` computed but not appearing in evaluation (check domain routing in evaluate.py)
   - `dc-bank-scan` missing from registry — debit card bank-level scan needed
4. **Tag live annotations with layer: 1/2/3** — metadata-only change, safe to do now
5. **ATM/POS Layer 2a** — first FOUNDATION pass on system_model.json (6 months of data now available)
6. Newsletter standardisation: blocked on Layer 2 signal evaluation
